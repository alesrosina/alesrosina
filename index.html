<section id="about">
  <p>
    My name is <b>Aleš Rosina</b>, currently living and working in <b>Zürich, Switzerland</b>. I have been working with web
    technologies almost all of my professional career. It all started in primary school, in
    1999, when I made my first website hosted on GeoCities. Soon I relised HTML & CSS is not enough, so I started
    exploring Microsoft stack (C#, ASP.NET, WebForms, ASP.NET MVC, …), where I spent a few years. Fast forward to today,
    I spent most of my time working on <b>Ruby on Rails</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> as my perferred technology stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nevertheless, I was always in contact with front-end technologies, since my main drive was always a nice and clean
    user interface.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was also active in the local community, organizing <b>Mobile Monday Slovenia</b> events and
    co-organizing <a href="http://www.tedxljubljana.com" target="_blank">TEDxLjubljana</a> events.
