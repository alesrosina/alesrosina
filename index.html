<section id="about">
  <p>
    I was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia, where I spent my first 30 years. I've finished Faculty of Computer Science at
    University of Ljubljana in 2009 and also worked in few local companies as Software Developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since I've entered University, I've traveled a lot and that gave me another sense of the world. It also triggered a
    wish, to go and try to live somewhere else, than a city I was born in. This happened in 2016, where I got an offer
    to move to Zürich, Switzerland. At first only for two months, but somehow it happened, that I stayed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having settled here, I've also become a father, which was (and still is) a big change in life and is just bringing a
    smile (and sometimes tears) on my face.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like to work with open minded people and in a team, since I think we can make something big only together. I'm
    quite strong in web development, with most of my latest background being Ruby on Rails & JavaScript frontend (Vuejs,
    React, Angular, etc). Lately I've been also focusing on helping and organizing other developers in a team as a team
    lead.
