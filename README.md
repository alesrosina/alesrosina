## About
This is a project for my personal website [alesrosina.com](http://alesrosina.com). 
It showcases a very simple usage of `sass` precompiler in combination with node.js package manager `npm` and `grunt` task runner.

## Install
### Prerequisites

- nodejs
- grunt

You need to manually install all of above. Homebrew (http://brew.sh/) is recomended for installing all prerequisites:

```
brew install node
brew install -g grunt-cli
```

*Note: with `-g` switch you will install grunt globally. See https://nodejs.org for more details.* 

### Initial setup

Set your terminal to project root folder and run:

```
npm install
grunt
```

## Running

For development, you can use:

```
grunt watch
```
