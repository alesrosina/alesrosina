## About
This is a project for my personal website [alesrosina.com](http://alesrosina.com).
It showcases a very simple usage of `jekyll` static page generator. See [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/) for
more info on how to build and run such a site.

If you're interested, you can also deep dive into code - not a lot to see, basically just some SCSS & HTML.
