Let's see if I'll be able to cope with this - but the idea is, to write more. I was never good in writing and this always presented a bit of stress, maybe anxiety or even fear. Starting already in school, this was really not my thing.

Anyway, the point of this is to sometimes write some complete nonsense, more like a flow of thoughts, that makes sense at a given point in time and place. Maybe only to me. And sometimes I might write some structured text, which would, or better should, make some sense also to other readers. I might write some texts in English, some in Slovenian and some in German.

It's a chance to expand my vocabulary and grammar together with structuring my - usually - chaotic flow of thoughts. It's also a posibility to strengthen, or better said, to learn blind typing with all 10 fingers. In decent amount of time.

Let that be it for now.
